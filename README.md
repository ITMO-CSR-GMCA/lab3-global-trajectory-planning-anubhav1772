### Third laboratory work for course Robot Motion Planning and Control.

### Topic: Robot Path Planning using Potential Field Method

#### Tasks:
1. Write a program for planning a path from the initial point to the final point bypassing obstacles using the potential field method.
2. Independently determine the initial point of movement, the final point, and obstacles in the workspace.
3. The program code must reflect all the steps for constructing the potential field of the workspace, the order of calculating the gradient, and determining the subsequent direction of movement.
4. Illustrate achieved results.
